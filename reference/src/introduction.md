# Introduction

This book is the primary reference for the Meow programming language.

This document is not normative. It may include details specific to `meowc`, and
should not be taken as a specification for the Meow language.

## What this is

This book contains two types of material:
- Chapters that informally describe each language construct and their use.
- Chapters that informally describe the memory model, concurrency model,
  runtime services, linkage model, and debugging facilities.

## What this is not

This book does not serve as an introduction to the language. Basic familiarity
with the language is assumed. Separate guides are planned for the future to
help acquire such familiarity.

Similarly, this book does not document the specifics of `meowc` or other tools
related to developing in Meow. Those will be documented as they are
implemented.
