# Introduction

This book is the primary reference for the Meow programming language.

This document is not normative. It may include details specific to `meowc`, and
should not be taken as a specification for the Rust language. We intend to
produce such a document someday, but this is what we have for now.

## What this is not

This book does not serve as an introduction to the language. Basic familiarity
with the language is assumed. Separate guides are planned for the future to
help acquire such familiarity.

Similarly, this book does not document the specifics of `meowc` or other tools
related to developing in Meow. Those will be documented as they are
implemented.
